### Reasoning and Confidence Evaluation

# The ontology is designed to answer the competency question "How many unique departments are listed in the dataset?".
# The class :UniqueDepartment is introduced to represent unique departments.
# The object property :hasUniqueDepartment is used to associate an entity with a unique department.
# The datatype property :countOfUniqueDepartments is used to represent the count of unique departments.
# The class :DatasetWithUniqueDepartments is defined as a subclass of :Dataset that must have at least one unique department.
# The ontology can be tested by creating instances of :Dataset with associated :Department instances and querying for the count of unique departments.
